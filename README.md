# SurvivalClustering :boom:

SurvivalClustering provides benchmarking for various techniques used in survival analysis. 
The dataset used for this purpose is the TCGA data. 

## References ðŸ”—

This work is based on the Vadesc methodology, originally presented by i6092467. We have taken the foundational principles of this technology and incorporated the TCGA dataset for enhanced performance and analysis. For further details about the original work, please refer to the following resources:

- [ðŸ”Ž Vadesc GitHub Repository](https://github.com/i6092467/vadesc)
- [ðŸ“„ Original Vadesc Paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=RQ428ZptQfU)

We acknowledge and appreciate the efforts of the original authors in developing the Vadesc technology, which has served as a stepping stone for our project.

## Development Environment :hammer_and_wrench:

- tensorflow 2.4.0 
- tensorflow-gpu 2.4.0
- CUDA 11.0
- cuDNN 8.0

## Dependencies :books:

- scikit-learn=0.22.2.post1

This benchmark has been reproduced in a Windows environment. :computer:

## Additional Environment Setup :wrench:

In some cases, you may need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools. For installation, please follow this [link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=48159).

1. Access the link above, select the language according to your user environment, and proceed with the download. :link: 
2. Install Microsoft Build Tools 2015 version and reboot after installation. :wrench: 

## Execution Steps :running:

1. For data preprocessing, execute `example/dataprocessing.ipynb`. :arrow_forward:
2. Then, in the terminal, run `python main.py`. :arrow_forward:

If you wish to run in a Jupyter Notebook environment, follow the steps below:

1. First, execute the dataprocessing as mentioned above.
2. Then, run `clusting.ipynb`. :arrow_forward:
